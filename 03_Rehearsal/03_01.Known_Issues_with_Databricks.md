# Known Issues (while running the job), possible causes and fixes.

## GC in the cluster: The cluster has run out of memory

- Cause of the Issue
  * The cluster is small.
  * Write Throughput is low.
  * Our tooling is not doing memory management optimally.
- Fix for the Issue
  * Try to get a cluster with same # cores but higher memory.
  * Increase the RU at the destination.
  * Report back GC Issues.

## Migration is successful but the count of documents in source is more than the count of documents at destination.

- Cause of the Issue
  * Possibly there were errors while migrating some of the records
- Fix for the Issue
  * Goto status db and look for stats in _status and _error collection.If the errors were transient, then running the tool with Resume option will fix. Else, running the Job with the main class CompareAndUpdate will do a full DB scan and update the missing records. Since it is doing full DB scan it will take lot of time.

## Migration is successful but the count of documents in source is less than the count of documents at destination.

- Cause of the Issue
  * Source DB is getting modified
- Fix for the Issue
  * Do online migration to detect if the source db is not getting modified. On mongo, count() operator given an estimate of number of documents, use .count_documents() to get correct number of documents.  

## Connection Issues with the mongo source: Timeouts, Socket Exception, Lock and Wait exception.

- Cause of the Issue
  * VPN
  * Transient
  * Source is resource constraint.
- Fix for the Issue
  * VPN Peering.
  * Dedicated Source for Read.
  * Use a smaller cluster to read.

## Different issues at Cosmos

- Cause of the Issues 429, 413, 403
  * 429 means RU provisioned is lower than what is required by the current cluster size.
  * 413 means document size is too large
  * 403 means 20G limit of unsharded collection has been reached.
- Fix for the Issue
  * To remedy 429, either reduce the cluster size or increase RU provision.  
  * To remedy 413, increase the max allowed document size to 16 MB.  
  * To remedy 403, shard the collection.

## Shard Key incompatibility: Complex Type with > 8 fields.  

- Cause of the Issue
  * The shard key is not supported at Cosmos.
- Fix for the Issue
  * Either create an unsharded collection if the size of the collection is < 20G or modify the shard key so that it is supported at Cosmos.

## Unique Key Constraint Violation Exception  

- Cause of the Issue
  * Empty shard key value are allowed in mongo native but not in Cosmos Mongo RU Base
  * There are two shard key values, one of type String, seconf of type ObjectId, but both have same value.  
- Fix for the Issue
  * Config has a parameter: uniqueConstraintViolationHandling. You can use this to handle records which violate this constraint.
