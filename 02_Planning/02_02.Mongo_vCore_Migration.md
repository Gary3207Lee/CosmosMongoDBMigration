## Online / Offline Migration Mechanizm

- Offline Migration:  A snapshot based bulk copy from source to target. New data added/updated/deleted on the source after the snapshot will not be copied to the target. The application downtime required will depend on the time taken for the bulk copy activity to complete.

- Online Migration: Apart from the bulk data copy activity done in the offline migration, a change stream monitors all additions/updates/deletes and stores them into an intermediate data store. After the bulk data copy is completed the data in the intermediate is copied to the target to make sure all updates done during the migration process are also copied to the target. The application downtime required will be minimal.
